# What is RSBot?
[RSBot](https://www.powerbot.org/) is a powerful tool, known in the gaming community as a 'bot', written in Java. It is developed by a private limited company called Dequeue Ltd. The program loads the java applet of the massively multiplayer online roleplaying game called [RuneScape](https://www.runescape.com) and due to the nature of java, RSBot is able to see what the gamer (user) sees plus more as it can read directly from the game in runtime. Using the information it obtains from the game applet, RSBot is able to play the game just as a gamer would. This means the user can go about their day and the bot will do all the heavy grinding to make in-game money/resources and advance levels.

# So what is this repository?
At the time this repository was created - RSBot, while remaining closed-source, allowed a portion of its community to develop extended framework/tools and bot scripts. Also at the time this repository was created, I was one of the scripters and noticed there was some functionality lacking in RSBot's API so I decided I would fill these gaps by extending the existing API for the other script writers. As you'll see I only got around to creating the API for the FriendChat (basically an in-game group/clan chat where people have varying ranks) but had intended to write more classes. However this class is a standalone module and worked perfectly at the time of publishing.
